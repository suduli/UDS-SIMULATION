## ‚úÖ Test 1: Panel Now Closes Properly (30 seconds)

### Steps:
1. **Open app** ‚Üí Click "Sequences" button (header)
2. **Create test sequence**:
   - Click "+ New Sequence"
   - Name: "Test Stuck Fix"
   - Add step: SID `0x10`, subFunction `0x01`
   - Click "Save"
3. **Click "Execute"** (green play button)
4. **Watch execution panel open**
5. **Click "Stop" button** (red stop icon)
6. **Wait 1 second** ‚Üí Button changes to "Done" (cyan checkmark)
7. **Click "Done"** 

### ‚úÖ Expected Result:
- Panel closes completely
- Clicking Execute again shows fresh execution
- No stuck state

### ‚ùå Old Behavior:
- Panel stayed frozen
- Stop button didn't work
- Had to refresh page

---

## ‚úÖ Test 2: Close Button Works (15 seconds)

### Steps:
1. **Execute any sequence**
2. **During or after execution**, click **√ó button** (top right)

### ‚úÖ Expected Result:
- Panel closes immediately
- State completely cleared
- Reopen shows fresh state

### ‚ùå Old Behavior:
- √ó button seemed to work but state persisted
- Reopening showed old execution

## ‚úÖ Test 3: Auto-Close on Success (45 seconds)

### Steps:
1. **Load template**: Click "üìö Templates" ‚Üí "Basic Diagnostic Workflow"
2. **Click "Load"**
3. **Click "Execute"**
4. **Watch execution** (should succeed - 2 green checkmarks)
5. **Wait 2 seconds** ‚Üí Panel auto-closes

### ‚úÖ Expected Result:

- After 2 seconds, panel automatically closes
- Ready for next execution

### ‚ùå Old Behavior:
- Manual close required
- No auto-cleanup

## ‚úÖ Test 4: Error Handling - NRC 0x12 (OLD TEMPLATE)

**Note**: This tests the old broken template to verify error handling works.

### Steps:
1. **Create manual sequence**:
   - Name: "Test NRC Error"
   - Step 1: SID `0x10`, subFunction `0x03` (will trigger NRC 0x12 in some cases)
2. **Execute**
3. **If NRC 0x12 appears**:
   - Execution should still complete (not hang)
   - Stop button ‚Üí Done button transition
   - Click Done to close

### ‚úÖ Expected Result:
- Error shown in log: "Negative Response (NRC: 0x12)"
- Progress shows "1 Completed, Success Rate: 0%"
- Done button appears
- Can close and retry

### ‚ùå Old Behavior:
- Stuck at "Step 1 of 1, 0% Complete"
- No way to proceed
- Panel frozen

---

## ‚úÖ Test 5: Multiple Executions (1 minute)

### Steps:
1. **Execute sequence** ‚Üí Close when done
2. **Execute again** ‚Üí Close when done
3. **Execute third time** ‚Üí Close when done

### ‚úÖ Expected Result:
- Each execution starts fresh
- No accumulated state
- No performance degradation
- All three work identically

### ‚ùå Old Behavior:
- First execution might work
- Second and beyond showed old state
- Eventually required page refresh

## Quick Verification Checklist

After running tests above, verify:

- [ ] **Stop button** ‚Üí clears state after 1 second
- [ ] **Done button** ‚Üí appears when execution complete
- [ ] **Close (√ó) button** ‚Üí clears state immediately
- [ ] **Auto-close** ‚Üí works after successful execution (2 sec)
- [ ] **Fresh state** ‚Üí each execution is independent
- [ ] **Error handling** ‚Üí NRC errors don't cause freeze
- [ ] **Console errors** ‚Üí none (check browser DevTools)

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Panel still stuck
**Solution**: 
- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh: `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows) or `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac)
- Verify build completed: `npm run build`

### Issue: √ó button doesn't clear state
**Solution**:
- Check console for errors
- Verify `clearSequenceExecution` in UDSContext
- Ensure latest build is running

### Issue: Done button doesn't appear
**Solution**:
- Execution might not have completed
- Check `currentSequence.isRunning === false`
- Look for completion flags in state

## Performance Check

### Memory Leak Test:
1. Execute sequence 10 times
2. Open DevTools ‚Üí Performance ‚Üí Memory
3. Check if memory keeps growing

### ‚úÖ Expected:
- Memory stable or minor fluctuation
- No significant growth after 10 executions

### ‚ùå Would indicate problem:
- Memory grows ~10MB+ per execution
- Never gets garbage collected

## Success Criteria

**All tests pass if**:
1. ‚úÖ No stuck panels
2. ‚úÖ All buttons work as expected
3. ‚úÖ State clears properly every time
4. ‚úÖ Can execute unlimited sequences
5. ‚úÖ No console errors
6. ‚úÖ No memory leaks

**If any test fails**:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify build is latest: `npm run build`
3. Hard refresh browser
4. Review `EXECUTION_STUCK_STATE_FIX.md` for implementation details
