# Packet Animation Fade-In Fix

## Issue
Request packets (`10 01`) appeared to be "stuck" at the Client position during animation, creating visual confusion.

## Root Cause
The previous animation keyframes had the packet become fully visible (`opacity: 1`) at 15% of the animation timeline, but the `left` position didn't start changing until later. This meant:

```css
/* BEFORE - Problematic */
@keyframes packet-request {
  0% {
    left: 0%;      /* Starts at Client */
    opacity: 0;
  }
  15% {
    /* left still at 0% - NOT SPECIFIED! */
    opacity: 1;    /* Fully visible at Client position ❌ */
  }
  100% {
    left: 100%;    /* Ends at ECU */
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```

Because `left` wasn't specified at the 15% keyframe, the browser interpolated it, but the packet became fully visible while still very close to its starting position (Client), making it look like it was stationary.

## Solution
Synchronized the position change with the opacity fade-in, so the packet only becomes visible **while moving away** from its origin:

```css
/* AFTER - Fixed */
@keyframes packet-request {
  0% {
    left: 0%;      /* Starts at Client */
    opacity: 0;    /* Invisible */
  }
  5% {
    left: 5%;      /* Moved 5% away from Client ✅ */
    opacity: 1;    /* Now fully visible */
  }
  90% {
    left: 95%;     /* Nearly at ECU */
    opacity: 1;    /* Still visible */
  }
  100% {
    left: 100%;    /* Reached ECU */
    opacity: 0;    /* Fades out */
  }
}
```

## Visual Result

### Before Fix
```
T=0ms - 375ms (15% of 2500ms):
┌────┐
│ 💻 │ [10 01]  ← Packet visible, appears stuck at Client ❌
└────┘

T=375ms - 2125ms:
┌────┐
│ 💻 │    ➔ ➔ ➔ [10 01] ➔ ➔ ➔     ECU
└────┘         Packet traveling
```

### After Fix
```
T=0ms - 125ms (5% of 2500ms):
┌────┐
│ 💻 │ ▫    ← Packet fading in while moving away ✅
└────┘

T=125ms - 2250ms:
┌────┐
│ 💻 │    ➔ ➔ ➔ [10 01] ➔ ➔ ➔     ECU
└────┘         Packet traveling clearly

T=2250ms - 2500ms:
┌────┐
│ 💻 │                   ▫  ┌────┐
└────┘                      │ 🖥 │  ← Fading out at ECU
                            └────┘
```

## Changes Made

### File: `src/index.css`

#### Request Packet Animation
```diff
@keyframes packet-request {
  0% {
    left: 0%;
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-50%) scale(0.8);
  }
-  15% {
+  5% {
+    left: 5%;
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(-50%) scale(1);
  }
-  85% {
+  90% {
+    left: 95%;
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(-50%) scale(1);
  }
  100% {
    left: 100%;
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-50%) scale(0.8);
  }
}
```

#### Response Packet Animation
```diff
@keyframes packet-response {
  0% {
    left: 100%;
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-50%) scale(0.8);
  }
-  15% {
+  5% {
+    left: 95%;
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(-50%) scale(1);
  }
-  85% {
+  90% {
+    left: 5%;
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(-50%) scale(1);
  }
  100% {
    left: 0%;
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(-50%) scale(0.8);
  }
}
```

## Technical Details

### Fade-In Window
- **Duration:** 5% of animation (125ms out of 2500ms)
- **Position change:** 0% → 5% (5% of channel width)
- **Opacity change:** 0 → 1 (fully transparent to fully opaque)
- **Result:** Packet appears to "emerge" while already in motion

### Visible Travel Window
- **Duration:** 85% of animation (2125ms)
- **Position:** Request: 5% → 95%, Response: 95% → 5%
- **Visibility:** Fully opaque throughout journey
- **Result:** Clear, smooth movement across the channel

### Fade-Out Window
- **Duration:** 10% of animation (250ms)
- **Position change:** 95% → 100% or 5% → 0%
- **Opacity change:** 1 → 0
- **Result:** Packet "dissolves" as it reaches destination

## Benefits

1. **No Static Appearance:** Packets never look stuck at origin nodes
2. **Immediate Motion Perception:** Users see movement from the first visible frame
3. **Smoother Visual Flow:** The fade-in/out creates a more polished effect
4. **Reduced Confusion:** Clear distinction between animated packets and static data displays
5. **Better Timing Perception:** The visible portion accurately represents travel time

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Request packet (`10 01`) doesn't appear stuck at Client
- [x] Response packet (`50 01...`) doesn't appear stuck at ECU  
- [x] Packets are visible throughout most of their journey (85% of animation)
- [x] Fade-in is smooth and quick (125ms)
- [x] Fade-out is smooth at destination (250ms)
- [x] No visual overlap with static data boxes
- [x] Animation feels responsive and natural
