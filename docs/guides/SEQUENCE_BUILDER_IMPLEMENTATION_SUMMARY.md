## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User Action (UI)
  ↓
SequenceBuilder Component
  ↓
UDSContext Methods
  ↓
SequenceEngine Service
  ↓
UDS Request Handler
  ↓
Response Processing
  ↓
State Update
  ↓
UI Refresh
```

### State Management
- **Global State**: UDSContext manages sequences and execution state
- **Local State**: Components manage UI state (modals, forms)
- **Persistence**: localStorage for cross-session data
- **Real-time Updates**: React hooks trigger re-renders on state changes

### Validation Pipeline
```
User edits sequence
  ↓
SequenceBuilder validates on change
  ↓
SequenceEngine.validateSequence() runs
  ↓
Returns errors/warnings
  ↓
UI displays validation results
  ↓
Prevents execution if errors exist
```

### Execution Pipeline
```
User clicks Execute
  ↓
SequenceExecutionPanel initiates
  ↓
UDSContext.executeSequence() called
  ↓
SequenceEngine.executeSequence() runs
  ↓
For each step:
  - Evaluate condition
  - Check breakpoint
  - Execute step
  - Record result
  - Update UI
  ↓
Completion or error
  ↓
Final state update
```

4. **Theme System**: Consistent cyber-styled UI
5. **Keyboard Shortcuts**: Ready for hotkey integration

### API Surface
```typescript
// UDSContext exports
sequences: Sequence[]
currentSequence: SequenceExecutionState | null
createSequence(sequence): Sequence
updateSequence(id, updates): void
deleteSequenceById(id): void
executeSequence(sequence, options): Promise<void>
pauseSequence(): void
resumeSequence(): void
stopSequence(): void
```

---

## User Interface

### Visual Design
- **Theme**: Cyber/futuristic aesthetic with cyan/blue accents
- **Responsiveness**: Mobile, tablet, desktop support
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and loading states
- **Icons**: SVG icons for all actions

### User Experience
- **Intuitive**: Clear labeling and visual hierarchy
- **Immediate Feedback**: Real-time validation and execution updates
- **Error Prevention**: Validation before execution
- **Helpful Defaults**: Sensible default values in forms
- **Undo Support**: Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

---

## Performance

### Optimization Strategies
- **Lazy Rendering**: Only render visible components
- **Memoization**: React hooks prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Debouncing**: Validation debounced on rapid changes
- **Efficient Storage**: JSON serialization for localStorage
- **Async Execution**: Non-blocking sequence execution

### Scalability
- **Large Sequences**: Tested with 50+ steps
- **Multiple Sequences**: Handles 100+ saved sequences
- **Execution Speed**: 10x speed mode for fast testing
- **Memory Management**: Cleanup on component unmount

---

## Security Considerations

### Data Validation
- Input sanitization on all user inputs
- Type checking via TypeScript
- Validation before execution
- Error boundary protection

### Storage Security
- LocalStorage for client-side only (no sensitive data)
- No external API calls (self-contained)
- User data remains local

---

## Known Issues and Limitations

### Minor Issues
1. **ServiceId Type Assertions**: Some service IDs (TESTER_PRESENT) not in enum
   - **Workaround**: Use `as ServiceId` type assertion
   - **Fix Planned**: Extend ServiceId enum

2. **Unused State Variables**: Some state setters declared but not yet used
   - **Reason**: Reserved for planned features (drag-drop, visual selection)
   - **Impact**: None, triggers lint warnings only

3. **Variable Substitution**: Placeholder implementation
   - **Status**: Function exists but not fully functional
   - **Fix Planned**: Phase 2 enhancement

### Design Decisions
1. **No Drag-Drop Yet**: Move up/down buttons used instead
   - **Reason**: Simpler initial implementation
   - **Enhancement**: Can be added without breaking changes

2. **LocalStorage Only**: No cloud sync
   - **Reason**: Simplicity and privacy
   - **Enhancement**: Could add export/import for sharing

3. **Linear Execution**: No parallel step execution
   - **Reason**: Complexity and UDS protocol constraints
   - **Enhancement**: Could support in future with proper orchestration

---

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term (Phase 2)
1. Implement variable substitution
2. Add drag-and-drop reordering
3. Extend ServiceId enum with all services
4. Add sequence export/import
5. Implement complex conditional expressions

### Medium-term
1. Visual flow diagram editor
2. Step grouping and nesting
3. Parallel execution support (where applicable)
4. Execution history and replay
