- ‚úÖ Added individual color coding per card (Cyan, Purple, Green, Slate)
- ‚úÖ Implemented progress bars for session timeouts
- ‚úÖ Added animated pulse indicators for active states
- ‚úÖ Integrated activity graphs for data transfer visualization
- ‚úÖ Hover effects with gradient overlays for depth
- ‚úÖ Staggered animations (0s, 0.1s, 0.2s, 0.3s delays)

**Impact:** Dramatically improved visual hierarchy and scanability. Users can now quickly identify protocol state at a glance.

---

### 2. **Enhanced Background Effects** ‚úÖ
**Issue Identified:** Static, flat background lacking depth
**Review Feedback:** "No particle effects, missing modern visual effects"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Added 20 floating animated particles with randomized positions
- ‚úÖ Enhanced grid opacity and color (from 10% to 20%)
- ‚úÖ Added third glowing orb for more depth
- ‚úÖ Implemented varied animation delays for organic movement
- ‚úÖ Maintained performance with CSS-only animations

**Impact:** Significantly increased visual appeal and depth perception without performance overhead.

---

### 3. **Upgraded Global Styles** ‚úÖ
**Issue Identified:** Limited animation system, no glassmorphism utilities
**Review Feedback:** "Missing modern UI patterns, no depth effects"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Added glassmorphism utilities (`.glass-card` with backdrop blur)

- ‚úÖ Gradient text utilities

**Impact:** Provides consistent, reusable styling foundation for modern UI patterns across the app.

---

### 4. **Enhanced Response Visualizer** ‚úÖ
**Issue Identified:** Plain text display, no visual appeal, missing timing info
**Review Feedback:** "No animation for incoming data, ASCII representation basic"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Visual byte blocks with hover effects (scale-110 on hover)
- ‚úÖ Color-coded explanations with emoji icons (‚úì, ‚Üí, ‚ö†Ô∏è)
- ‚úÖ Enhanced NRC display with warning emoji (‚ö†Ô∏è instead of SVG)
- ‚úÖ Protocol trace timeline graph (24-point activity visualization)
- ‚úÖ Improved ASCII representation with styled container
- ‚úÖ Response time display with ‚è±Ô∏è emoji
- ‚úÖ Staggered byte animations (0.1s delay per byte)

**Impact:** Transforms technical data into visually engaging, easy-to-understand information.

### 5. **Additional Feature Panels** ‚úÖ
**Issue Identified:** Missing advanced features mentioned in review
**Review Feedback:** "Need DTC management, learning center, statistics dashboard"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ **DTC Management Panel:**
  - Displays diagnostic trouble codes with status badges
  - Color-coded by severity (Confirmed/Pending/Cleared)
  - "View All DTCs" action button
  
- ‚úÖ **Learning Center Panel:**
  - Tutorial progress tracking
  - Lesson completion indicators
  - "Continue Learning" CTA with play icon
  
- ‚úÖ **Statistics Dashboard:**
  - 4-metric grid layout (Requests, Success Rate, Services, DTCs)
  - Real-time counters
  - Color-coded metric cards

**Impact:** Extends functionality significantly, providing learning resources and diagnostic insights.

---

### 6. **Restructured App Layout** ‚úÖ
**Issue Identified:** Inefficient space usage, cramped layout
**Review Feedback:** "Poor use of whitespace, everything compressed"

**Implementation:**
- ‚úÖ Full-width 4-card dashboard at top
- ‚úÖ 2-column grid for Request Builder and Response Visualizer
- ‚úÖ 3-column grid for additional features below
- ‚úÖ Improved spacing (gap-6 throughout)
- ‚úÖ Responsive breakpoints (md, lg)
- ‚úÖ Better vertical rhythm

**Impact:** Creates breathing room, improves content hierarchy, and enhances overall readability.
