# Advanced Hex Editor - User Guide

## Quick Start

The Advanced Hex Editor is a visual tool for building UDS requests byte-by-byte, making it easier to construct complex diagnostic messages without typing hex manually.

2. This loads: `22 F1 90`
3. Click "Apply to Request"
4. Send!

**Or build manually:**
1. Click `22` (Read Data By Identifier)
2. Click `F1` (DID high byte)
3. Click `90` (DID low byte)

### Switching to Extended Session

1. Click "Templates" ‚Üí "Extended Session"
2. This loads: `10 03`
3. Click "Apply to Request"

**Or use suggestions:**
1. Click `10` (Diagnostic Session Control)
2. Suggestions appear: "Default Session (0x01)", "Extended Session (0x03)"
3. Click "Extended Session" suggestion

### Requesting Security Seed

1. Click "Templates" ‚Üí "Security Seed Request"
2. This loads: `27 01`
3. Click "Apply to Request"

### Clearing DTCs

1. Click "Templates" ‚Üí "Clear All DTCs"
2. This loads: `14 FF FF FF`
3. Click "Apply to Request"

### Creating Custom Request

1. Start with service ID (e.g., `31` for Routine Control)
2. Add sub-function (e.g., `01` for Start Routine)
3. Add routine ID (e.g., `FF 00`)
4. Add any data bytes
5. Review validation messages
6. Click "Apply to Request"

---

## üíæ Saving Templates

Created a useful byte sequence? Save it!

1. Build your byte sequence
2. Click **"Save as Template"**
3. Enter a name (e.g., "My Custom Routine")
4. Enter a description
5. Template is saved locally

**To reuse:**
- Open Templates section
- Find your template under "Custom" category
- Click to load

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Tips

### Reordering Bytes
- Drag any byte to a new position
- Other bytes automatically shift
- Position numbers update

### Deleting Bytes
- Click to select the byte
- Click the red ‚ùå button that appears
- Or drag to another position and it's removed from original

### Understanding Validation

**Errors (Must Fix):**
- Missing required bytes (e.g., "Session Control requires sub-function")
- Incorrect message length
- Invalid byte sequences

**Warnings (Optional):**
- Non-standard sub-functions
- Unusual byte counts
- Uncommon service IDs

You can proceed with warnings, but errors indicate the ECU will likely reject the request.

### Using Suggestions Effectively

Suggestions are based on:
- Current service ID
- Position in the sequence
- UDS protocol standards

Higher confidence = more likely to be correct for your use case.

### Search Tips

- Search is case-insensitive
- Partial matches work
- Can search across hex, decimal, and names simultaneously

---

## üîß Troubleshooting

### "Visual Editor button not showing"
‚û°Ô∏è Make sure you're in **Manual Hex Mode** (toggle at the top of Request Builder)

### "Drag and drop not working"
‚û°Ô∏è Try clicking bytes instead. If drag still doesn't work, check browser compatibility.

### "My template disappeared"
‚û°Ô∏è Custom templates are stored in browser localStorage. If you cleared browser data, they're lost. Consider exporting important templates.

### "Validation says error but I think it's correct"
‚û°Ô∏è Validation is based on ISO 14229 standard. Some manufacturer-specific requests may trigger warnings. You can still apply the request.

### "Can't find a specific byte"
‚û°Ô∏è Use the search bar! Type the hex value (e.g., "A5") or decimal (e.g., "165")

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

Currently, the editor is mouse/touch-focused. Keyboard shortcuts may be added in future updates.

**Current keyboard support:**
- Type in search box
- Tab to navigate
- Enter to confirm dialogs

## üéì Learning Resources

### Understanding UDS Requests

Every UDS request has this structure:
```
[Service ID] [Sub-Function] [Data...]
```

**Example: Extended Session**
```
10 03
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ Sub-function (0x03 = Extended)
‚îî‚îÄ Service ID (0x10 = Diagnostic Session Control)
```

**Example: Read VIN**
```
22 F1 90
‚îÇ  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚î¥‚îÄ Data Identifier (0xF190 = VIN)
‚îî‚îÄ Service ID (0x22 = Read Data By Identifier)
```

### Common Service IDs

| Hex | Service Name | Use Case |
|-----|-------------|----------|
| 0x10 | Diagnostic Session Control | Change session mode |
| 0x11 | ECU Reset | Reset the ECU |
| 0x14 | Clear DTC | Clear trouble codes |
| 0x19 | Read DTC Information | Read trouble codes |
| 0x22 | Read Data By Identifier | Read specific data |
| 0x27 | Security Access | Unlock protected functions |
| 0x2E | Write Data By Identifier | Write specific data |
| 0x31 | Routine Control | Run ECU routines |
| 0x3E | Tester Present | Keep session alive |

## üì± Mobile/Touch Support

The editor works on touch devices with some limitations:

- **Tap** instead of click
- **Long-press and drag** for drag-and-drop (browser dependent)
- If drag doesn't work, use tap to add bytes
- All features accessible via tapping

---

## üÜò Need Help?

1. **Hover tooltips**: Hover over any byte for information
2. **Validation messages**: Read the error/warning messages carefully
3. **Suggestions**: The smart suggestions often show the right next step
4. **Templates**: Use templates as learning examples

---

## üéâ Pro Tips

1. **Start with templates** - Modify existing templates rather than starting from scratch
2. **Watch suggestions** - They adapt based on your current bytes
3. **Use search frequently** - Faster than scrolling through 256 bytes
4. **Save frequently used sequences** - Build your own template library
5. **Check validation before applying** - Fix errors early
6. **Use recent bytes** - Your most-used bytes are always handy
