## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. SID (Service ID)
- What it is: Unique identifier for each UDS service (e.g., 0x10)
- Why it matters: Determines what operation to perform
- How to use it: First byte of every request

### 2. Subfunction
- What it is: Refinement of the service (e.g., 0x01 for Default Session)
- Why it matters: Same service can do different things
- How to use it: Second byte of requests that require it

### 3. NRC (Negative Response Code)
- What it is: Error code when request fails (e.g., 0x12)
- Why it matters: Tells you exactly what went wrong
- How to use it: For debugging and error handling

### 4. Diagnostic Sessions
- **Default (0x01)**: Safe mode, read-only
- **Programming (0x02)**: Flash programming mode
- **Extended (0x03)**: Advanced diagnostics mode

### 5. State Management
- Session state determines permissions
- Security state controls access to protected operations
- Timeout handling returns to safe state

## Common Questions Answered

### Q: Why do I need to enter a session if the ECU is already on?
**A**: Sessions control **permissions**, not power. Even when the ECU is on, you need the right session to access certain features.

📖 **See**: SID_10_DIAGNOSTIC_SESSION_CONTROL.md → "What is SID 10?"

---

### Q: What's the difference between Extended and Programming sessions?
**A**: 
- **Extended**: For advanced diagnostics (read/write data, run routines)
- **Programming**: For flash memory operations (firmware updates)

📖 **See**: SID_10_DIAGNOSTIC_SESSION_CONTROL.md → "Subfunctions Explained"

---

### Q: Why does my security unlock reset when I change sessions?
**A**: Security resets to protect the ECU. **Exception**: Staying in Extended Session preserves security.

📖 **See**: SID_10_DIAGNOSTIC_SESSION_CONTROL.md → "Security Reset Behavior"

---

### Q: How do I know which session a service requires?
**A**: Check the service interaction matrix - it lists session requirements for all services.

📖 **See**: SID_10_SERVICE_INTERACTIONS.md → "Session Requirements by Service"

---

### Q: What does NRC 0x7F mean?
**A**: "Service Not Supported in Active Session" - you're in the wrong session for that service.

📖 **See**: SID_10_DIAGNOSTIC_SESSION_CONTROL.md → "Negative Response Codes"

---

### Q: How do I implement session timeout?
**A**: Use a timer that resets on each request and returns to Default Session on timeout.

📖 **See**: SID_10_PRACTICAL_IMPLEMENTATION.md → "Session Timeout Handling"

---
