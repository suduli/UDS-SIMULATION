**In-depth Review: Color Palette & Theme Modes**

**Color Palette Analysis**

*Primary Colors:*
- The site uses **strong blues, grays, and off-whites** as core palette colors.
- Blue shades likely appear in accent elements (buttons, highlights), typical HEX/RGB values might be #1976D2 (blue), #E3EDF7 (light blue background).
- Gray tones are prominent in both background panels and borders (#2C2C2E, #444, #E0E0E0).
- Standard white (#FFF) and black (#000) are used in light and dark backgrounds.

*Secondary & Accent Colors:*
- **Red** is used for critical alerts (e.g., DTC critical), possibly #D32F2F or similar.
- **Orange/yellow** appears for warning statuses (#FFA726, #FFEB3B).
- **Green** used for success indicators (#43A047, #C8E6C9).
- Some **purple or teal** hints may show in highlights or links depending on theme mode.

*Theme Modes Reviewed:*
- **Light Mode:** Uses off-white/very light gray backgrounds with dark text for high readability. Apart from blue and gray, accent colors for alerts and statuses stand out well. However, contrast could be increased for disabled/muted fields, which may blur into the background.
- **Dark Mode:** Grounds the site in deep gray backgrounds, using lighter text. Accent colors retain vibrance. Some panels might be too similar in shade, affecting separation. Blue accents are effective, but status (warning/error) indicators could pop more with saturated colors.
- **High Contrast Mode:** Improves distinction between interactive/page elements (if enabled), but needs checks on contrast for non-primary UI (tooltips, disabled elements).

**Accessibility & Contrast**
- **Contrast ratio** for main headings, buttons, and alert colors generally passes accessibility standards, but muted secondary info and disabled controls might not.
- All status alerts (critical, warning, info, success) are clearly color-coded, but pairing with icons and bold text would improve scan-ability.
- Input fields and focus states need higher contrast borders/highlights, especially in dark mode.
- Consider color-blind accessibility: Avoid using only color for status (add icons or text labels).

**Consistency and Visual Harmony**
- Core palette and accent colors are used consistently, but in some lighter modes, secondary panels blend with backgrounds.
- Review shades used for tertiary UI (charts, tutorial progress, tooltips) to prevent inconsistency.
- Tip: Use a single accent family for actionable items (all buttons/links in blue, for example) or provide clear variations for different actions.

**Actionable Recommendations**
- **Enhance contrast** of secondary/muted elements; adjust gray backgrounds to ensure readable contrast with info text.
- **Standardize accent colors** for critical, warning, success globally.
- **Add icons and bolds** to alert/status text for color-blind users.
- **Increase separation** between working area and sidebar/stats panels with subtle shading or border changes.
- Use **slightly tinted backgrounds** (rather than pure white/black) for more sophisticated feel and reduced eye strain.
- Perform full **WCAG contrast audits** for text, controls, and icons in all modes.
