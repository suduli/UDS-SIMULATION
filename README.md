# UDS Protocol Interactive Website

## Project Overview

An interactive web-based platform for testing Unified Diagnostic Services (UDS) protocol according to ISO 14229-1 standard, supporting both CAN and Ethernet (DoIP) interfaces.

## Features

- Full implementation of all 20 UDS services (0x10, 0x11, 0x14, 0x19, 0x22, 0x23, 0x24, 0x27, 0x28, 0x2A, 0x2C, 0x2E, 0x2F, 0x31, 0x34, 0x35, 0x36, 0x37, 0x38, 0x3D, 0x3E, 0x85)
- Interactive drag-and-drop message builder
- Simulated CAN and DoIP network interfaces
- Virtual ECU responder with configurable behavior
- Support for extended addressing and functional addressing
- Security access simulation with seed-key algorithms
- Network timing and error simulation
- Test sequence automation
- Bus load and traffic simulation
- Data export with timestamping
