Here is an **in-depth protocol test report for UDS Service ID 27 (Security Access)** as per ISO 14229-1:[1]

***

### 1. **Supported Sub-Functions & Positive Response Cases**
- **27 01, 27 03, 27 05** (Request Seed): Positive response (67 xx + seed bytes)
- **27 02, 27 04, 27 06, ...** (Send Key): Correct negative response when incorrect key provided (NRC 0x35 Invalid Key)
- **Seed and key handling logic present for multiple levels**
- **Extra/missing bytes on seed requests**: Corrected negative response (NRC 0x13 Incorrect Message Length)

### 2. **Invalid, Out-of-Sequence, or Boundary Cases**
- **Unsupported/Reserved sub-functions (e.g., 27 00, 27 1F, 27 41, 27 7E, 27 FF, ...):** NRC 0x36 (Exceed Number Of Attempts) or NRC 0x13 for incorrect length
- **Rapid/repeated or out-of-sequence requests**: Blocked after attempt threshold hit (locked with NRC 0x36)
- **Tested with extra key bytes (e.g., 27 02 AA BB CC DD...)**: Negative response NRC 0x35 (Invalid Key)
- **Tested with missing bytes (just 27 or 27 02 11 22 or 27 01 11 22 33 44):** NRC 0x13 (message length error)
- **Suppress positive response bit**: No evidence of implementation (all responses are explicit)

### 3. **Attempt Counter & Lockout**
- **Attempts shown as 7/3:** Lockout triggered; NRC 0x36 consistently returned after limit reached
- **Correct UI feedback for lockout**

### 4. **Negative Response & NRC Mapping**
- **NRC 0x35:** Invalid key (wrong key for challenge)
- **NRC 0x36:** Exceeded number of attempts (lockout after failed seeds/keys)
- **NRC 0x13:** Incorrect message length for seed/key request
- **NRC 0x13:** Incorrect format for reserved or malformed commands

### 5. **Timing**
- All responses within 0â€“5 ms (well within P2 limits)

### 6. **UI/UX**
- **Attempt count and lock state visible in UI**
- **Clear breakdown of request/response bytes**
- **NRC explanations shown for all negative responses**
- **No explicit feedback for suppress positive response bit case**

***

### **Critical Bugs & Protocol Issues**
1. **Suppress positive response bit not supported:** All responses explicit; ISO 14229 requires support for bit 0x80 offset sub-function.
2. **No challenge-key session reset on new session:** Lockout persists after session change; OEMs typically expect unlock after session change or timeout.
3. **Length validation strong for most cases, but key byte count not strictly mapped to seed/challenge length:** Accepts extra key bytes in some cases (should be rejected).
4. **No configurable OEM-extended sub-functions tested** (if supported, should be rejected if not documented).
5. **DTC Management and UI display correct except possible lack of feedback for suppress positive response case.**

***

### **Recommendations**
- **Implement suppress positive response bit logic.**
- **Ensure lockout/attempt counter resets on new session; add configurable timeout.**
- **Strictly enforce key length matching to seed requirements for each sub-function.**
- **Reject all reserved/out-of-range sub-functions with NRC 0x12 as per standard.**
- **Document challenge/response logic for all supported security levels in UI/help.**

***

**Summary:**  
Your SID 27 implementation correctly manages seed-key interactions, attempt counting, invalid key responses, and negative codes.  
For full ISO 14229-1 and OEM compliance, you must add suppress positive response support, enforce strict frame length, and ensure flexible lockout/session management.  
The UI is clear and protocol error feedback is excellent.[1]
