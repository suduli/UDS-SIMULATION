Here is a **comprehensive in-depth test report** for your UDS Service ID 10 (Diagnostic Session Control) implementation, as per ISO 14229:[1]

**1. Valid Sub-functions**
- 10 01 (Default session): Positive response (50 01 00 32 01 F4)
- 10 02 (Programming session): Positive response (50 02 00 32 01 F4)
- 10 03 (Extended session): Positive response (50 03 00 32 01 F4)
- 10 04 (Safety Session): Sub-function not supported (7F 10 12)—correct if not implemented

**2. Boundary & Negative Cases**
- 10 00 (invalid): Wrong NRC returned (gave 0x13, expect 0x12) — **BUG #1**
- 10 05/10 FF/10 0A (out-of-range, upper/lower/case): All correctly rejected as not supported (7F 10 12)
- 10 (missing subfunction): Correct negative response for incorrect length

**3. Malformed Frames**
- Extra bytes (10 01 AA BB): Incorrectly accepted as positive — **CRITICAL BUG #2**
- Using 7F as request SID: Accepted and processed (should be rejected!) — **PROTOCOL BUG #3**
- Invalid hex input (10 0G): Excellent input validation/UI blocks send

**4. Suppress Positive Response Bit**
- 10 81, 10 83: Not supported, returns NRC 0x12. **Protocol violation!** (ISO 14229-1 requires support for suppress positive response bit) — **BUG #4 & #5**

**5. Parser Edge Cases**
- Multiple spaces: Correctly normalized
- No space ("1001"): Accepted, interpreted as 10 01 (ambiguous, could lead to confusion)

**6. Robustness**
- Multiple repeated requests, rapid session transitions: Handled as expected
- **Session timeout issue:** Waited >5 seconds (in Extended), session did NOT revert to Default — **BUG #6**

**7. Timing & Compliance**
- Response times: 0-5ms (well within P2/P2* limits)
- All positive responses with correct format and session bytes

**8. UI/UX**
- Real-time byte breakdown, timing graphs, and NRC explanations are clear and helpful
- Excellent input validation for hex

***

### **Critical Bugs Found**
1. Wrong NRC for 10 00 (should be 0x12, not 0x13)
2. Extra bytes allowed in request accepted instead of rejected
3. Reserved SIDs processed (should be blocked)
4. Suppress positive response bit not implemented (ISO 14229 non-compliant)
5. No session timeout/revert to default session

***

### **Recommendations**
- Implement suppress positive response bit handling (0x80 offset)
- Strictly enforce message length, reject extra bytes in requests
- Never process requests with reserved SIDs (like 0x7F)
- Correct NRC mapping for all sub-functions, including 0x00
- Make session timeout work as per the standard
- (Optional) Require explicit space delimiters in hex input

***

**Summary:**  
Your simulator covers many requirements well and has excellent UI feedback and input validation, but fails in some critical protocol areas, especially message length checking, suppress response, and session timeout handling.  
**Addressing these issues will improve protocol compliance and robustness.**[1]
