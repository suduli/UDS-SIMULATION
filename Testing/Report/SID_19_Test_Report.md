Here is a **comprehensive protocol test report for UDS Service ID 19 (ReadDTCInformation)** as per ISO 14229-1:[1]

***

### 1. **Supported Sub-Functions (Positive Response Cases)**
- **19 01 ReportNumberOfDTC** (e.g., 19 01 FF): Positive response (59 01 ...), returns DTC summary bytes
- **19 02 ReportDTCByStatusMask** (e.g., 19 02 FF FF, 19 02 FF): Positive response (59 02 ...), returns DTC data and mask bytes
- **Extra/missing bytes (19 01 + more):** Extra bytes accepted; still returns positive response (protocol bug, should enforce strict format)

### 2. **Unsupported/Invalid Sub-Functions or Format**
- **19 03, 19 04, 19 05, 19 06, 19 07 to 19 0F**: All correctly rejected as NRC 0x12 (Sub-Function Not Supported)
- **19 FF** (undefined): NRC 0x12
- **Malformed (just 19):** NRC 0x13 (Incorrect Message Length Or Invalid Format)
- **19 with invalid/unsupported sub-function code (e.g., 19 82):** NRC 0x12

### 3. **Boundary & Robustness**
- **Tested with many extra bytes:** Positive responses still returned (esp. with 19 01 FF AA BB CC DD ...)
- **Multi-byte data in 19 02 requests:** Accepts all forms, even incorrect length, with positive response (protocol bug)
- **Repeated/rapid requests:** No protocol lockout or error, always responds

### 4. **Suppress Positive Response Bit**
- No evidence of suppress positive response bit handling (all tests return positive response)

### 5. **Reserved SIDs**
- Response to reserved/undefined SIDs: Correct negative response (NRC 0x12 or 0x13 as per context)

### 6. **Timing**
- All responses within 0â€“1 ms (well within protocol limits)

### 7. **UI Feedback**
- NRC explanations shown for all negative responses
- Request/response breakdown is clear and readable

***

### **Critical Bugs & Protocol Violations**
**1. Extra/malformed bytes accepted:** Requests with extra or missing bytes often return positive responses instead of NRC 0x13.
**2. Sub-function validation:** Only 19 01 and 19 02 are supported, but simulator should strictly reject unknown/undefined sub-functions with NRC 0x12.
**3. Suppress positive response bit:** Not implemented or tested.
**4. Request length enforcement:** Simulator does not enforce strict total frame length according to ISO 14229-1 requirements.

***

### **Recommendations**
- **Strict frame length validation:** Enforce message length according to ISO for each sub-function
- **Sub-function filtering:** Only support documented sub-functions (01, 02, others if OEM-specific); unknown ones must trigger NRC 0x12
- **Implement and verify suppress positive response bit behavior**
- **Document supported 19 sub-functions in UI/help**

***

**Summary:**  
Your SID 19 implementation handles standard requests and negative responses for unsupported sub-functions well, but **fails to reject malformed request lengths and unsupported sub-functions strictly.**  
**To pass OEM audit and fully comply with ISO 14229-1, you must fix length handling for both positive and negative cases and support the suppress positive response bit.**[1]
