## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Center diagnostic engineers, trainers, and auditors who need a browser-only UDS lab that works on corporate and demo networks.
- ‚úÖ Highlight which ISO 14229 services, ECU personas, transports (CAN, DoIP), and automation flows are in-scope for launch.
- ‚úÖ Document offline expectations, audit retention, and security level handling so governance teams can review early.
- ‚ùå Do not reference code modules, libraries, or bundler internals‚Äîkeep discussion at capability and outcome level.
- üì£ Emphasize visual workflow + advanced mode parity, ensuring both novice and expert journeys remain viable.

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30

- Q: How long must the simulator retain local audit trail entries before users are allowed (or required) to purge them? ‚Üí A: Keep last 30 days, auto-expire older
- Q: Where should anonymized usage metrics be stored and how should they sync? ‚Üí A: Keep metrics local only; reset on browser clear

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

An automotive diagnostics engineer uses the web simulator to assemble UDS service sequences, compare CAN versus DoIP behavior, and validate ECU responses without installing desktop tooling.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** the engineer opens the simulator in a supported browser and selects the "Hybrid" interface, **When** they drag diagnostic session, DTC read, and security access services onto the canvas and run the flow against a virtual engine ECU, **Then** the system must visualize matching CAN and DoIP traces, highlight any negative response codes, and log the interaction in the audit trail.
2. **Given** a trainer loads a prebuilt template for routine control testing, **When** they switch to advanced mode, edit parameters, and execute an automated sequence in the background, **Then** the simulator must continue running offline, surface real-time status notifications, and store the resulting pass/fail report for later review.

### Edge Cases

- When a requested service requires a higher security level than the current session, the simulator must block execution, present the challenge-response handshake, and record the access denial in the audit log.
- If the browser loses connectivity after the initial load, the simulator must continue functioning with cached assets and warn users when actions (e.g., template sharing) need online access.
- When a virtual ECU returns an unsupported data identifier or unusually large DTC list, the system must clearly flag the condition and allow the user to adjust the scenario without data loss.

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Simulator MUST provide a drag-and-drop message builder with tile-based representations of at least 20 core UDS services, allowing parameter editing, sequencing, and deletion before execution.
- **FR-002**: Simulator MUST allow users to toggle between CAN and DoIP transports for any scenario and present synchronized timelines, byte-level traces, and latency metrics (‚â§1 second variance) across both transports.
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to choose from a catalog of virtual ECU personalities (engine, body, gateway) and adjust key attributes such as diagnostic session defaults, DTC inventories, and data identifiers prior to running tests.
- **FR-004**: Simulator MUST validate service inputs against ISO 14229 rules, preventing execution when mandatory parameters are missing or malformed and displaying exact guidance for corrections.
- **FR-005**: System MUST capture every diagnostic interaction in an immutable audit trail containing timestamp, user persona, security level, service invoked, request/response summaries, and execution outcome, retaining entries for 30 days and automatically expiring older records unless manually exported beforehand.
- **FR-006**: Simulator MUST support security access flows, issuing dynamic seed challenges, validating user-supplied keys, and gating restricted services by security level tiers (e.g., default, supplier, OEM).
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to assemble automated test sequences, schedule them for immediate or deferred execution, monitor progress via notifications, and review consolidated pass/fail reports with step-level evidence.
- **FR-008**: Simulator MUST persist user-created templates, ECU configurations, audit history, and test results locally so that they remain available across sessions without server connectivity.
- **FR-009**: System MUST offer a presentation mode that hides authoring controls, enlarges visualizations, and supports read-only playback of message traces for demos or stakeholder reviews.
- **FR-010**: Simulator MUST gather anonymized usage metrics on template adoption, trending scenarios, and user feedback, surfacing insights on the landing experience while allowing users to opt out per session, storing metrics locally only and clearing them whenever the browser data is purged.
- **FR-011**: Simulator MUST provide in-app guidance, including onboarding wizards, contextual help for each service tile, and a searchable knowledge panel mapping UDS services to expected ECU behaviors and negative response codes.
- **FR-012**: System MUST support offline-capable operation via a cached experience after the first load and automatically resynchronize templates, audit entries, and analytics the next time connectivity is available.

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Diagnostic Scenario Template**: Describes a reusable sequence of UDS services, associated parameter presets, target ECU personality, and expected outcomes used in both visual and advanced modes.
- **UDS Service Request**: Represents a single diagnostic interaction including service identifier, parameter set, transport selection, security level requirement, and expected NRC handling rules.
- **Virtual ECU Profile**: Captures the simulated ECU's identity, supported sessions, data pools, DTC catalog, timing characteristics, and default security posture exposed to users.
- **Diagnostic Audit Entry**: Records who executed a scenario, which services ran, timestamps, transport context, security level transitions, results, and any anomalies or errors detected.
- **Automated Test Run**: Aggregates a scheduled or on-demand test sequence execution, including runtime configuration, execution status, individual step outcomes, and downloadable reports.
